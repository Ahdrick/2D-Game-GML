/*
    This script sets a horizontal and/or a vertical speed
    to a movement entity. This speed will NOT be relative to 
    the previous horizontal and vertical speeds. It is sort
    of like motion_set but it takes a horizontal and
    vertical speeds as arguments instead of a direction and
    speed.
